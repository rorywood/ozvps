Replit Fix Brief: Server OS Display + Console Button + Power Icon + Server List Icon Update
1) Show Operating System on Server Cards/List (Servers page)
Requirement

On the Servers list page (before clicking into a server), each server row/card must display the current installed OS.

Implementation

Source OS from VirtFusion server details (preferred fields in order):

explicit operating_system / template_name / os_name

image / distro / template label

fallback: Unknown

Display format (compact):

OS icon (same mapping used in reinstall list where possible)

Text: Ubuntu 22.04 / Debian 12 etc

If VirtFusion only exposes “last installed template”, use that and label it as OS.

UI placement

In each server item near:

CPU/RAM/Storage

or directly under server name

Keep it visible without expanding the row.

2) Show Operating System on Dashboard server widgets
Requirement

On Dashboard, wherever servers are listed/summarised, show the installed OS the same way as the Servers list.

Implementation

Reuse the same server-to-os mapping function + logo mapping.

Do not duplicate logic.

3) Fix Console Button (currently broken)
Requirement

The “Console” button must reliably open the console page/view.

Implementation checklist

Verify route and handler:

Button must navigate to correct route for server console (e.g. /servers/:id/console)

Verify API call used to obtain console session/token:

Ensure backend endpoint exists and returns what noVNC expects (URL + token + websocket endpoint)

Common bug to fix:

Using server internal ID vs VirtFusion server ID mismatch

Button calling a removed endpoint after the reinstall changes

Add a visible error state:

If console session cannot be created, show inline error text and do not silently fail.

Preserve the 15-second console lock rule already implemented:

If locked, show countdown overlay rather than failing.

4) Fix Power Button Icon Orientation (upside down)
Requirement

Power icon must be oriented correctly and visually consistent.

Implementation

Remove any CSS transform/rotation applied to the icon or its parent.

Ensure the icon used is the correct glyph (power symbol, not “logout” or “standby” rotated).

Standardise icon sizing in server list and server detail header.

5) Replace Server Icon (far left) with better icon
Requirement

Change the far-left generic server icon to a cleaner, modern server glyph.

Implementation

Replace current icon component with a consistent “Server” icon across:

Dashboard server list

Servers list page

Keep the OS logo separate; the server icon is just the server indicator.

Use the same icon library you already use elsewhere (keep bundle minimal).

Acceptance Criteria

Servers list shows OS for every server (or “Unknown” if not available).

Dashboard server list shows OS too.

Console button works and opens the console reliably (or shows a real error).

Power icon is no longer upside down.

Server icon on the far left is replaced with a better consistent icon across pages.
