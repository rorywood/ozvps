Replit Fix Brief Addendum: OS Logos Everywhere + Console Popout from List + Bigger Console Font
1) Show actual OS logo on Dashboard + Servers list (MANDATORY)
Requirement

Both Dashboard and Servers list must display the actual OS logo icon (Alma/CentOS/Debian/Fedora/Ubuntu/openSUSE/Oracle/Other), not just text.

Implementation

Reuse the existing getOsLogoUrl(serverOrTemplate) mapping used in reinstall.

Add logo rendering in two places:

Servers list row/card: place OS logo next to the OS text (or replace text-only indicator).

Dashboard server widgets/list: same OS logo next to OS name.

Image rules:

Size: 18–22px height (consistent)

loading="lazy"

onError fallback → linux_logo.png

If OS unknown:

show linux_logo.png + “Unknown”

2) Servers list “Console” button must open as pop-out window
Requirement

On the Servers list (not inside server detail), the Console action must open a new pop-out window directly.

Behaviour

Clicking Console opens a new window:

route: /servers/:id/console?popup=1

window features: reasonable size (e.g. 1200x800), resizable, scrollbars

Popout must still respect the 15-second console lock:

If locked: popout shows the lock screen + countdown until ready, then auto-connect.

Implementation details

Use window.open() from the list view.

Ensure popout route uses a minimal chrome layout:

no sidebar

no heavy header

just console + connection status + clipboard controls

3) Increase console font size (readability)
Requirement

Console text is currently too small. Increase it.

Implementation (noVNC)

noVNC typically renders via canvas; “font size” is effectively controlled by:

scaling / CSS zoom on the canvas container

viewport scaling settings

Implement:

Default scale increased (e.g. 110–125%) for both embedded and popout console

Add a simple control: A- / A+ (or “Zoom - / Zoom +”) with 3 presets: 100%, 115%, 130%

Persist per-user in localStorage:

consoleScale=1.15 etc

Rules:

Must not break keyboard input mapping.

Must not blur excessively; choose scale that keeps text crisp.

Acceptance Criteria

Dashboard and Servers list both show the correct OS logo for each server.

Servers list Console opens a working pop-out console window.

Console text is visibly larger by default, with simple zoom presets that persist.
